    "This project aims to systematically examine how multiple definitions of HRD relate to drug response across all PARP inhibitors available in the dataset. So each of the HRD feature engineering notebooks will derive homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status using one of three complementary strategies: (1) BRCA1/2 double-hit alteration status, (2) computed genomic scar–based HRD scores, and (3) COSMIC mutational signatures. These engineered features will then be harmonized with PARP inhibitor AUC measurements to generate a modeling-ready dataset for downstream statistical analysis and predictive modeling of HRD-associated drug response.

    "**Objective**: Identify and encode BRCA1/2 alterations, including damaging mutations and copy number loss, to define the first component of HRD for downstream feature engineering and integration with PARPi response. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology**: First, damaging somatic mutations are extracted from mutation matrices to identify potential loss-of-function events. Second, gene-level copy number values are obtained and log2-transformed to normalize distributions and facilitate thresholding. Third, gene-specific thresholds are calculated using a standard-deviation approach to define loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) and homozygous deletion events. Fourth, double-hit status is assigned for cell lines with a damaging mutation co-occurring with a copy number loss below the LOH threshold. Fifth, homozygous deletion flags are generated for extreme copy number losses below the deep deletion threshold. Finally, both mechanisms are integrated into a single BRCA-HRD feature, capturing all evidence of BRCA inactivation while keeping mechanisms distinct for interpretability.\n",

    "**BRCA1** and **BRCA2** are core components of the **homologous recombination** (**HR**) DNA repair pathway, which mediates high-fidelity repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Loss-of-function alterations resulting in biallelic inactivation of either gene impair HR activity, leading to **homologous recombination deficiency** (**HRD**). Tumors with BRCA-associated HRD accumulate characteristic patterns of genomic instability and are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibition, making BRCA mutation status one of the most clincally validated biomarkers of HRD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biallelic inactivation refers to the loss of function of both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene within a given cell. Because BRCA1 and BRCA2 act as tumor suppressors, inactivation of a single allele is generally insufficient to fully abrogate homologous recombination; instead, both copies must be inactivated to produce a clear-cut HR-deficient phenotype. This “two-hit” state can arise through several mechanisms:\n",
    "1) A germline pathogenic mutation in one allele accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the remaining wild-type allele.\n",
    "2) A somatic mutation in one allele accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the remaining wild-type allele.\n",
    "3) Two independent somatic mutations affecting each allele (much less common).\n",
    "4) Homozygous deletion of the gene.\n",
    "5) Promoter hypermethylation or other epigenetic silencing serving as a second hit (more commonly observed for BRCA1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, not all five mechanisms can be comprehensively captured due to data limitations. DepMap does not reliably distinguish germline from somatic mutation origin, so germline+LOH and somatic+LOH scenarios are operationally indistinguishable and will be treated equivalently as mutation-associated biallelic inactivation. Promoter methylation is also not available in the public DepMap resources and will therefore be excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the available datasets, two mechanisms can be systematically approximated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Somatic mutation + copy number loss (LOH)**, identified by integrating the damaging mutation matrix with gene-level copy number values from WGS.\n",
    "- **Homozygous deletion**, inferred from sufficiently low gene-level copy number values independent of mutation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structural events will be derived from `damaging_mutations_df` and `cn_gene_wgs_df` to construct a reproducible proxy for BRCA biallelic inactivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: HRD can also arise from alterations in other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes. However, this section focuses exclusively on BRCA1 and BRCA2 as canonical and clinically validated determinants of HRD. Other HRR genes (e.g., RAD51, PALB2) may be explored in future iterations of this notebook.\n",

    "Based on the validation checks, the distributions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 copy number values have noticeable differences. Using a single threshold across both genes could misclassify loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events, either underestimating true biallelic inactivation or inflating false positives. Therefore, gene-specific thresholds for CN loss will be determined empirically from the data before defining BRCA1/2 double-hit status. This ensures that the resulting HRD calls are biologically grounded and reflect the distinct copy number landscapes of each gene."

    "The log2-transformed copy number data is used because it centers neutral diploid values around ~1 (this dataset isn’t in the standard log2 ratios around 0), compresses outliers, and better accommodates gene-specific variability than raw CN values.\n",

    "- **BRCA1** shows a tighter distribution centered slightly above 1.0, with lower variance and a narrower interquartile range.\n",

For this dataset, the LOH thresholds are approximately 0.749 for BRCA1 and 0.562 for BRCA2.\n",

    "Because there is no standardized copy number classification framework specific to DepMap cancer cell line data, a gene-specific, standard-deviation–based thresholding approach was adopted. This method adapts to each gene’s empirical distribution and captures both moderate copy number reductions (putative LOH) and extreme losses (putative homozygous deletions) for downstream BRCA double-hit HRD classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach, 52 BRCA1 LOH candidates and 22 BRCA2 LOH candidates were identified across the cell line cohort. These events must be evaluated in conjunction with somatic damaging mutation status to determine true biallelic inactivation (“double-hit”) and assign BRCA-based HRD labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For homozygous deletions, 7 total events were identified. Because deep deletions typically reflect loss of both alleles, these events represent strong candidates for biallelic inactivation and will be classified as BRCA-driven HRD, subject to manual verification of copy number quality metrics.\n",

However, this method is not well suited to the present dataset. DepMap WGS gene-level CN values are log2-transformed and normalized in a dataset-specific manner, and do not correspond directly to an absolute diploid baseline of two copies. Applying fixed thresholds derived from theoretical diploid assumptions risks systematic misclassification and inflation of LOH or deep deletion calls.\n",

    "Accordingly, gene-specific thresholds derived from the observed BRCA1 and BRCA2 log2 CN distributions provide a more appropriate and internally consistent strategy. This approach accounts for the empirical variability and central tendency of each gene, ensuring that flagged events reflect meaningful relative copy number reductions rather than artifacts of platform scaling or normalization."

    "To convert the continuous composite genomic HRD score into a binary label, a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was fitted to the score distribution. This approach assumes that cell lines comprise two overlapping subpopulations corresponding to HRD-negative (lower genomic instability) and HRD-positive (higher genomic instability) states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection point of the two Gaussian components was computed analytically and used as the classification threshold, providing an objective, data-driven cutoff rather than relying on an arbitrary percentile-based rule. Using this approach, a threshold of −0.406 was identified and applied to define the binary genomic scar–based HRD label (HRD_genomic). This threshold lies within the dense region of the score distribution and does not rely on extreme values, indicating a stable and robust separation between subpopulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess biological validity, the resulting classification was compared against BRCA1/2 mutation status. The majority of BRCA-mutant cell lines were classified as HRD-positive under this threshold, confirming that the genomic scar–based definition captures canonical HRD cases while also identifying BRCA wild-type models with HRD-like genomic instability. Together, these results support both the statistical validity and biological relevance of the engineered HRD_genomic label."
