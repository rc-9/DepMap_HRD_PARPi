prism_repurposing_secondary

The secondary PRISM Repurposing dataset contains the results of pooled-cell line chemical-perturbation viability screens for 1,448 compounds screened against 489 cell lines in an 8-step, 4-fold dilution, starting from 10uM. 

Additionally, 192 oncology compounds (152 of them are technical redo's for the existing compounds) are screened against 770 cell lines. This data is identified using a `screen_id` of "MTS010".  It is recommended to use MTS010 when available. MTS010 was not included in the analysis for Corsello et al. 2019, DOI:10.1101/730119.


Data are processed according to the following protocol:

- Calculate the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each bead-replicate pair.
- Remove outlier-pools. MFI values are log-transformed and centered to the median logMFI for each cell line on each detection plate. For each well on a plate, the median of the centered values is standardized (using median and MAD) against all other wells in the same position in the same screen. Data from wells with a standardized score greater than 5 or less than -5 is filtered.
- Remove cell line-plates with low control separation. For each cell line-detection plate combination, the SSMD is calculated between the logMFI of positive and negative control treatments. Cell line-detection plates with an SSMD > -2 are removed.
- Divide data from each well-detection plate by the median of control barcodes from the same well-detection plate.
- Calculate log2-fold-change for data relative to negative-control wells from the same cell line on the same detection plate.
- Positive-control and negative-control treatments are removed.
- Run ComBat for each treatment condition (compound plate-well combination), considering log-viability values as probes and cell line pool-replicate combinations as batches.
- Median-collapse each drug-dose-cell line combination
- Calculate viability data as two to the power of replicate-level logfold change data.
- Fit dose-response curves to viability data using drc R package.

Please note that this procedure is described in detail at Corsello et al. 2019, DOI:10.1101/730119 and the associated GitHub repo lives at https://github.com/broadinstitute/repurposing. For "MTS010" data, another (but similar) data processing pipeline is used and the associated code is maintained at https://github.com/broadinstitute/prism_data_processing.
